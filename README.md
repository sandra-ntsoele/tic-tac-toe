# Tic-Tac-t=Toe
A multi-platform version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Description
After teaching you the **basics of OOP**. R.B, Whitaker’s book *The C# Player’s Guide* challenges the reader to build a console Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

So I thought, why not first build a console version, then move on to the web from the web build a mobile version of the game as an opportunity to develop my skills.
